# Complex-Numbers
Implementation of a complex number class that provides the following operations:
- Construction without arguments
- Construction from the real part
- Construction from real and imaginary parts
- Real part: `double real()`
- Imaginary part: `double imag()`
- Module: `double abs()`
- Translation to string: `std::string str()`
- Addition: `+`, `+=`
- Subtraction: `-`, `-=`
- Multiplication: `*`, `*=`
- Division: `/`, `/=`
- Unary minus: `-`
- Complex conjugate: `~`
- Comparison for equality: `==`, `!=`
- Output to stream: `<<`

Types of expressions:

- Const (value is passed in the constructor)
- Variable (the variable name is passed in the constructor)
- Negate (unary minus)
- Conjugate (complex conjugate)
- Add
- Subtract
- Multiply
- Divide
